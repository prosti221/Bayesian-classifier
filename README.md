Implementing a Bayesian classifier using a gaussian distribution to classify different textures on an image. 
Multiple of these can be combined to create a one vs rest type classifier to increase the overall accuracy.
Doing this we go from 76% accuracy to 97% accuracy on the given texture images with the corresponding masks containing 4 different textures.
